jQuery UI Widget Library Template
====================================

This repo is a template for a jQuery UI widget library.  Clone this repo and Use it to create new jQuery UI widgets for your own projects.

Testing your widget
====================

This template uses Jasmine to specify the behaviour of your jQuery UI widget.  Jasmine is BDD for your JavaScript.  It works both in and outside the web browser, and provides a descriptive API for writing your specifications.

Running the tests in your browser
-----------------------------------

Open the <code>/spec/SpecRunner.html</code> file in your web browser to run the tests using the Jasmine browser test runner.

TODO
=====

* Add example widget tests (pass, fail, and pending)
* Implement widget
* Add support for running tests from the command-line
